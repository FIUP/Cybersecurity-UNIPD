SPRITZ group deployed a new encryption strategy ... but they forgot to write
the decryption part.

Can you help them?

The main.py contains the encryption code they used, and an encrypted secret contained
contained in secret.txt .

Be careful: the encryption function require, an information we do not have.
We only now that it is an integer greater than 0, and for sure lower than 1000.

Provide us a python solution to decrypt the "secret.txt".

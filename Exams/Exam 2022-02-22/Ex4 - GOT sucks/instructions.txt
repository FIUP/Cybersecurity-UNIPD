Can you rewrite the got finale and get the flag?

Do not patch this binary.
You MUST solve the challenge by providing a valid input.
You CANNOT just jump with the debugger to any function that directly prints the flag.
If you think you're breaking these rules with your solution, please ask the teachers.

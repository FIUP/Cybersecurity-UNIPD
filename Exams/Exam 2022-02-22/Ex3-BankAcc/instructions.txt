Can you access your bank account and get the flag?
The bank account must be accessed by providing ALWAYS THE SAME OTP.


You can patch the binary only in parts related to OTP.
Do not patch the binary to overcome username or password checks.
You MUST solve the challenge by providing valid inputs.
You CANNOT just jump with the debugger to any function that directly prints the flag.
If you think you're breaking these rules with your solution, please ask the teachers.
